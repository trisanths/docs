## Overview

CyrionAI uses API key authentication for all requests. Your API key serves as your identity and determines your access level and rate limits.

## Getting Your API Key

1. **Email grants@cyrionlabs.org** with proof of your organization's status
2. **Provide documentation** showing you're a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, government entity, school, library, etc.
3. **Receive your API key** upon approval

<Note>
  API keys are generated automatically when your account is approved. You can regenerate your key at any time from your dashboard.
</Note>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://api.cyrionlabs.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234567890abcdef" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
  }'
```

## SDK Authentication

### Python

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-1234567890abcdef",
    base_url="https://ai.cyrionlabs.org/v1"
)
```

### Node.js

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: 'sk-1234567890abcdef',
    baseURL: 'https://ai.cyrionlabs.org/v1'
});
```

### Environment Variables

For security, store your API key in environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
CYRIONAI_API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef
```

```python
# Python
import os
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv('CYRIONAI_API_KEY'),
    base_url="https://ai.cyrionlabs.org/v1"
)
```

```javascript
// Node.js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.CYRIONAI_API_KEY,
    baseURL: 'https://ai.cyrionlabs.org/v1'
});
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

### Do's ✅

- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use secure secret management systems
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity
- Use different keys for different environments (dev/staging/prod)

### Don'ts ❌

- Commit API keys to version control
- Share keys in public forums or chat
- Include keys in client-side JavaScript
- Use the same key across multiple applications
- Log API keys in application logs

## API Key Management

### Regenerating Your Key

If you suspect your API key has been compromised:

1. Go to your <Link href="https://app.cyrionlabs.com">dashboard</Link>
2. Navigate to API Keys section
3. Click "Regenerate Key"
4. Update your applications with the new key

<Note>
  Regenerating your key will immediately invalidate the old key. Make sure to update all applications before regenerating.
</Note>

### Key Permissions

API keys have the following permissions:

- **Read access** to your account information
- **Write access** to create completions, images, videos, and transcriptions
- **Admin access** (if granted) to manage users and grants

## Rate Limits

Your API key determines your rate limits:

| Endpoint | Rate Limit |
|----------|------------|
| Chat Completions | 100 requests/minute |
| Image Generation | 20 requests/minute |
| Video Generation | 10 requests/minute |
| Audio Transcription | 50 requests/minute |

<Note>
  Rate limits are per API key. Contact us if you need higher limits for your use case.
</Note>

## Error Responses

### Invalid API Key (401)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "invalid_api_key"
  }
}
```

### Missing API Key (401)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "No API key provided",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "missing_api_key"
  }
}
```

### Rate Limit Exceeded (429)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "type": "rate_limit_error",
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded"
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Authentication

You can test your API key by making a simple request to the models endpoint:

```bash
curl https://ai.cyrionlabs.org/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"
```

If successful, you'll receive a list of available models. If there's an authentication issue, you'll get an error response.

## Need Help?

If you're having trouble with authentication:

- Check that your API key is correct and not expired
- Ensure you're using the correct header format (`Bearer your-key`)
- Verify your account is active and not suspended

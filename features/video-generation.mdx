## Overview

Video generation allows you to create short videos from text descriptions using cutting-edge AI models. CyrionAI provides access to multiple video generation models including Pika Labs, Runway ML, and others.

## Basic Usage

### Simple Video Generation

```python
import cyrionai

client = cyrionai.CyrionAI(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.videos.generate(
    model="pika-labs",
    prompt="A nonprofit volunteer helping children in a community garden",
    response_format="url"
)

print(response.data[0].url)  # URL to the generated video
```

### Multiple Video Variations

```python
response = client.videos.generate(
    model="pika-labs",
    prompt="A diverse team working together on a community project",
    n=3  # Generate 3 variations
)

for i, video in enumerate(response.data):
    print(f"Video {i+1}: {video.url}")
```

## Parameters

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | Text description of the video you want to generate |

### Optional Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|

    model="pika-labs",
    prompt="A peaceful scene of volunteers planting trees in a park"
)
```

### Runway ML

Advanced video generation with cinematic quality:

```python
response = client.videos.generate(
    model="runway-ml",
    prompt="A professional documentary-style video of a nonprofit team meeting"
)
```

### Stable Video Diffusion

Open-source video generation model:

```python
response = client.videos.generate(
    model="stable-video-diffusion",
    prompt="An artistic animation of community building and collaboration"
)
```

## Video Specifications

- Most models generate videos between 3-10 seconds
- Duration varies by model and prompt complexity

### Resolution
- Standard resolution: 1024x576 (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Some models support higher resolutions

### Format
- Output format: MP4
- Compatible with most video players and platforms

## Best Practices

### 1. Write Clear, Action-Oriented Prompts

```python
# Good: Specific action and scene description
prompt = "A group of volunteers actively planting trees in a community park, with people working together, natural lighting"

# Avoid: Static or vague descriptions
prompt = "People in a park"
```

### 2. Include Motion and Activity

```python
# Include movement and action
prompt = "Children running and playing in a playground, with volunteers supervising, dynamic movement"

# Specify camera movement
prompt = "A slow pan across a community garden showing volunteers working, smooth camera movement"
```

### 3. Consider Visual Style and Atmosphere

```python
# Specify visual style
prompt = "A cinematic shot of a nonprofit team meeting, professional lighting, modern office setting"

# Include atmosphere and mood
prompt = "A warm, welcoming scene of volunteers serving food at a community kitchen, soft lighting"
```

### 4. Use Appropriate Models for Different Styles

```python
# For realistic, documentary-style videos
response = client.videos.generate(
    model="runway-ml",
    prompt="A professional documentary about a nonprofit's impact on the community"
)

# For artistic, creative videos
response = client.videos.generate(
    model="stable-video-diffusion",
    prompt="An artistic animation showing the journey of community transformation"
)
```

## Common Use Cases

## Integration Examples

### Download and Save Video

```python
import requests

response = client.videos.generate(
    model="pika-labs",
    prompt="A community garden video"
)

video_url = response.data[0].url

# Download the video
video_response = requests.get(video_url)
with open("community_garden.mp4", "wb") as f:
    f.write(video_response.content)
```

### Embed in Web Application

```python
# Generate video for web display
response = client.videos.generate(
    model="pika-labs",
    prompt="A nonprofit impact video"
)

video_url = response.data[0].url

# Use in HTML
html_code = f"""
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
    <source src="{video_url}" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
"""
```

### Batch Video Generation

```python
prompts = [
    "Volunteers helping at a food bank",
    "Children learning in an after-school program",
    "Community members planting trees",
    "A team meeting to plan fundraising events"
]

videos = []
for prompt in prompts:
    response = client.videos.generate(
        model="pika-labs",
        prompt=prompt
    )
    videos.append(response.data[0].url)
    print(f"Generated video for: {prompt}")
```

## Performance Considerations

### Generation Time
- Video generation typically takes 30-120 seconds
- Complex prompts may take longer
- Generation time varies by model

### Rate Limits
- Video generation: 10 requests per minute
- Plan accordingly for batch processing

### Quality vs Speed
- Higher quality models may take longer to generate
- Consider your use case when choosing models
